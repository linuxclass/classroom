## Course Description

This course is primarily oriented towards new users to Linux--people who've never even performed an install of Linux. As the course progresses, intermediate and advanced users will more likely be interested in joining. The end goal of this class is to teach each user the fundamentals of Linux, giving them the skills required to set up, maintain, and troubleshoot a Linux system.

## Course Objectives

After successfully completing this course, each user should be able to:

* Be completely comfortable at the command line.

* Organize and manage files, processes, and services.

* Write shell scripts to automate mundane tasks.

* Be comfortable with pipes, regular expressions, redirection, etc.

* Secure their system.

* Customize their system.

## Course Schedule (subject to change!)

### Week 1

This week we will be installing CentOS 7 in a virtual machine. Throughout this course, we will use VirtualBox virtual machines to create our own isolated network of servers. After we have set up Linux, we will have a short discussion regarding what Linux is.  We will then access the terminal for the first time and learn our first couple of commands.

* Read supplement material for Week 1.

* Download [CentOS 7 ISO](http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1503-01.iso).

* Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

* Exercise: Follow the video and install CentOS 7 inside a VM.

### Week 2

This week we will begin exploring the file system. In Linux, things can be put anywhere, but everything (text files, executables, etc) really does have a place where it belongs. We will look at where things belong. We will also explore the ways in which Linux differs from Windows in the file system. We will spend some time exploring the different file system types, and the advantages/disadvantages of each (of the most popular ones). After we've discussed the file system, we will spend some time traversing around it.

* Read supplement material for Week 2.

* Exercise: TBD

### Week 3

We're going to start exploring the BASH shell (redundant?). We'll look at different tricks, such as brace expansion, and see things as the shell sees them using echo. We'll begin writing very simple scripts (loops, branching) to automate some tasks.
